# Find and replace for Sketch 3

Finds complete text in selected layer(s) and replaces it with different text.  It's case sensitive at the moment.

You can access it from the menu **Plugins -> Find And Replace -> Find and Replace** 
or use the keyboard shortcut **cmd + shift + f**

At the moment, this is pretty basic and will only find complete text, not partial matches.  More features soon!
