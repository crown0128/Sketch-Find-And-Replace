### Setting up your environment

TODO 

### Docs

We always appreciate improvements to the documentation!

### Sending a Pull Request

For non-trivial changes, please open an issue with a proposal for a new feature or refactoring before starting work — we don’t want you to waste your time on a pull request that won’t be accepted.

On the other hand, sometimes the best way to start a discussion _is_ to send a pull request. Use your judgment!

In general, the contribution workflow looks like this:

* Open a new issue in the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/thierryc/Sketch-Find-And-Replace/issues).
* Fork the repo.
* Create a new feature branch based on the ’master’ branch.
* Submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.

Please try to keep your pull request **focused in scope** and avoid including unrelated commits.

After you have submitted your pull request, we’ll try to get back to you as soon as possible. We may suggest some changes or improvements.

Thank you for contributing!

Thierry
